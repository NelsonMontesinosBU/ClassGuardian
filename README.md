# ClassGuardian 

ClassGuardian is a class attendance tracker. It allows institution instructors to take class attendance, manage multiple courses, and generate attendance reports.

## How It Works

1. The instructor creates an account with ClassGuardian
2. The instructor enters his personal information: Name, Institution employed by
3. The instructor adds a new class to his dashboard, and provides detailed information about the class
4. The instructor shares with the class a special code for each student to join the class. Once the students enter the code they will be automatically added to the class roster
5. In the class roster page, the instructor can: Remove students, Take attendance, View attendance for a certain date, or download an attendance report
6. Attendance is taken by sending a computer generated code to all students registered in the class. The student then enters the attendance code and is marked as pesent on the attendace list. If the student fails to enter the code, the student will be marked as absent.

### Student Accounts

If an instructor is using ClassGuardian to track their class attendance, his students must create an "Student" ClassGuardian account in order to be able to join the class roster and justify their attendance via entering an attendace code.

1. The student creates a Student account with ClassGuardian
2. The student enters his personal information: Name, Student ID, Email
3. The student joins a class from his dashboard by entering a join code provided by the instructor. Once joined, the student will automatically be placed in the instructor's class roster.
4. In the class page, the student can: view information about the course, drop the course, or attend the class by entering a computer generated code sent by the instructor.
5. If a student drops a course he will be removed from the instructor's class roster.
